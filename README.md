### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
Welcome to Dena J. Clink's GitHub page. This is where I archive my code from peer-reviewed publications, and highlight current projects I am working on. 

#### R Packages
I currently have three R packages under development.

gibbonR - R package for automated detection and classification of acoustic signals \
https://github.com/DenaJGibbon/gibbonR

gibbonID - R package for visualization of acoustic data \
https://github.com/DenaJGibbon/gibbonID  

behaviouR - R package for online teaching of fundamental concepts in behavior and ecology \
https://github.com/DenaJGibbon/behaviouR 

#### Publications
The R code for select publications is available here.
